### Hi there 👋

I am a Software Developer with a background in Engineering. I have recently graduated from CodeClan and am now focussed on getting lost in the world of programming,  hoping to learn a few things in the process.

- [QperDiem](https://github.com/GSoutter/android_QperDiem) - an android app designed around the [Daily Questions Process](https://www.marshallgoldsmith.com/articles/questions-that-make-a-difference-the-daily-question-process)
- Deploying
<br/>


🎮 Some live demos of things I have worked on:
- [Worldly](https://worldly-geo-quiz.herokuapp.com/) - a geography quiz game
- [CrimeWatch](https://crime-watch-police-data.herokuapp.com/) - a web app that mapping data taken from the Police Data API  

🌱 I’m currently learning: 
- Cloud technologies (docker, AWS, Heroku, and Atlas)
- React Functional Components
- Python
<br/>


🤔 I’m looking for help with...a job
